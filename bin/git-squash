    Usage: git squash BASE_BRANCH

    Rewrites the history of the current feature branch by squashing it down to a
    single commit. Before squashing, BASE_BRANCH will be merged into this branch
    in order to bring it up to date. If there are merge conflicts, the squash
    will be aborted.

    The resulting squashed commit will have a nice commit message based on the
    feature branch name and the messages of the commits being squashed. You will
    be given a chance to revise the message before it is committed.

    Example:

    Let's say we are working in a branch `features/improve-webpacker-support`
    that was branched off of `master` and has the following commits:

      * 1393233 Document the new yarn:install task
      * f165c7a Allow `yarn install` flags to be customized
      * ea35e0f Explicitly run `yarn install` per webpacker docs
      * 6c46003 Include public/packs in linked_dirs by default

    If we run:

      $ git squash master

    This rewrites the history of our `features/improve-webpacker-support` branch
    to now be a single commit:

      * 932084e Feature: improve webpacker support

    And the commit message is:

      Feature: improve webpacker support

      - Include public/packs in linked_dirs by default
      - Explicitly run `yarn install` per webpacker docs
      - Allow `yarn install` flags to be customized
      - Document the new yarn:install task

    If we don't like the results of the squash, we can always "undo":

      $ git reset --hard 1393233

    If you really want to rewrite the history of #{current_branch} by squashing

    More likely you meant to run this command within your feature branch.
    The intended usage is:

      $ git switch FEATURE_BRANCH
